## This Mod Broke X

This mod completely overwrites the KeyBinding Screen and a lot of the control system.
If you have a mod that also modifies those systems. It is not guaranteed to work.

## Custom Clients

Custom Clients such as Lunar Client and LabyMod do not work with this mod.

I can not guarantee that this mod will work with any custom client.
Specifically, ones that are closed source. As I am not able to test and debug the issues.
And I refuse to support closed-source clients.
